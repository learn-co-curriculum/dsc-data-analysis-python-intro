    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll continue solidifying your knowledge of Python programming, descriptive statistics, and data visualization by performing key data analysis tasks. You will learn how to load data from CSV and JSON files into Python objects in memory, and wrap up with an analysis that joins together two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say \"base Python\", this means that we are emphasizing the data types and modules that are part of Python itself, rather than using third-party libraries. For much of this course, you will use numerous Python libraries such as `pandas` and StatsModels, but first we want to dig into how data analysis tasks can be performed without them.\n",

    "### Python Data Types and Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, our data is stored in data structures that are built into the Python language: numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc. For example, if we have this table of data:\n",
